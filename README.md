# Hunt: Showdown Gunshot Sound Quiz

## Description

Hunt: Showdown Gun Sound Learner is a web application designed to help players of Hunt: Showdown learn how to identify different guns by the sounds they make when fired. The app provides an interactive experience where users can listen to gunshot noises and then select the correct gun from a list of possible options. The difficulty of the game adapts based on the user's performance, making it more challenging as they improve and easier if they struggle.

## Features

- Play Sound: Users can click the "Play Sound" button to listen to the gunshot noise associated with a specific gun.
- Guess the Gun: Players are presented with a variable number of possible gun options and must select the correct one corresponding to the played sound.
- Adaptive Difficulty: The game's difficulty adjusts based on the user's performance, offering more or fewer options to choose from.
- Credits: The app credits Kamille, a person on Twitter who inspired the project and created a similar web app called [Weapon Sound Learner](https://kamille-twitter-url.com/weapon-sound-learner).
- Collaboration: The web app was created by Dylan Wallach in collaboration with Elle McMillen, who provided feature ideas and conducted user testing.
